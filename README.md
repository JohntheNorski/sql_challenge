# sql_challenge

Within the EmployeeSQL folder exists 3 main objects: a folder containing all of my CSV data, a snippet of my ERD,
and of course my SQL code. 

The SQL code drops all tables if they exist, then recreates them one at a time, copying over the import data
within the code. This has all been commented out for time saving purposes, but one can easily remove the 
/* and */ symbols surrounding it. All 'sections' have been separated by a long series of '-' for clarity.
All parts of the project have been named part 1 - epilogue and have been separated as well.
